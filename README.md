# Named-Entity-Recognition
Information retrieval is the process of extracting a pertinent set of facts
from a text or a document. The documents are of unstructured format, and thus,
information retrieval techniques aim at organizing this data. Named Entity Recognition is one of the information retrieval techniques which classifies a particular
word or a phrase in its appropriate class. NER can thus, also be used in extracting
entities from legal documents, which would help in providing an effective way to
represent these documents. This would reduce the task of a lawyer scrutinizing the
document, multiple times, to look for the same set of information.
